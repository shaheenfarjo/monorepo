# {{PROJECT_NAME}}

{{ORG_NAME}}'s production monorepo: a Next.js + Supabase SaaS platform built for
Iraq-first products. It ships Arabic (RTL) and English (LTR) out of the box, takes
local payments through Wayl, and can be packaged as native iOS and Android apps.

> **Starting a new project from this template?** Run `bun install && bun run init`
> first. It asks for your organization and project details, fills in every
> `{{PLACEHOLDER}}`, sets up environment files and removes the modules you don't need.

## Getting started

Prerequisites: Node.js 22+, [Bun](https://bun.sh), and Docker if you want to run
Supabase locally.

```sh
bun install
bun run init      # first time only, when creating a project from the template
bun run dev       # starts every app
```

Each app reads its environment from `.env.local` (created by `init` from the
`.env.example` files). Without credentials the apps still start; integrations whose
keys are missing are disabled.

## Common scripts

| Script | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `bun run dev` | Run all apps in development |
| `bun run build` | Build all apps |
| `bun run check` / `bun run fix` | Lint and format with Biome |
| `bun run typecheck` | Type-check every workspace |
| `bun run test` | Run all unit tests |
| `bun run check:placeholders` | Fail if `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` tokens remain after init |
